Ontology: BP

    superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell
    receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary
    immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and
    undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others
    differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and
    stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of
    this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus.

Term: canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction
Ontology: BP
Definition: An intracellular signaling cassette characterized by the I-kappaB-kinase (IKK)-dependent activation of
    NF-kappaB, also known as the canonical NF-kappaB signaling cascade. The cascade begins with activation of a trimeric
    IKK complex (consisting of catalytic kinase subunits IKKalpha and/or IKKbeta, and the regulatory scaffold protein
    NEMO) and ends with the regulation of transcription of target genes by NF-kappaB. In a resting state, NF-kappaB dimers
    are bound to I-kappaB proteins, sequestering NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of I-kappaB targets I-kappaB
    for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus releasing the NF-kappaB dimers, which can translocate to the
    nucleus to bind DNA and regulate transcription. The canonical NF-kappaB pathway is mainly stimulated by
    proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, antigen ligands, and toll-like
    receptors (TLRs).

Definition: The series of molecular signals mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane stress sensor PERK (PKR-like ER
    kinase). Begins with activation of PERK in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ends with regulation of a
    downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription. The main substrate of PERK is the translation initiation factor
    eIF2alpha. Serine-phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by PERK inactivates eIF2alpha and inhibits general protein translation.
    In addition, eIF2alpha phosphorylation preferentially increases the translation of selective mRNAs such as ATF4
    (activating transcription factor 4), which up regulates a subset of UPR genes required to restore folding capacity.

    transcription factor to the general (basal) transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, which bridges
    sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase, is also a transcription coactivator.

    walls of the sacs become more and more divided, until, in the mammals, the air spaces become minutely divided into

    factor to the general (basal) transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, which bridges sequence-specific DNA
    binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase, is also a transcription coactivator.
